## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sai Sandeep Naraparaju!

I'm a Data Scientist with 5 years of experience, specializing in **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing**. I've worked on various projects, delivering high-impact solutions across industries by leveraging innovative models and analytics tools to drive efficiency and decision-making.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a **Data Science Researcher** at the University of Texas at Arlington, focusing on developing advanced fact-checking tools using custom transformer-based models, alongside automating research pipelines using RAG and vector databases.
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced techniques in **large language models (LLMs)** and **efficient fine-tuning**.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on AI/ML projects, particularly in **NLP**, **time series forecasting**, and **LLM fine-tuning**.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **transformer models**, **time series forecasting**, and **LLM-based applications**!
